# Google Summer of Code 2026

The Gambit project is sumbitting projects as an organization for [Google Summer of Code 2026](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/).
Prospective contributors interested in working with the Gambit team should read the "Contributor Guidance" and "Project Ideas" sections below.

> Google Summer of Code is a global, online program focused on bringing new contributors into open source software development. GSoC Contributors work with an open source organization on a 12+ week programming project under the guidance of mentors.

## Contributor Guidance

Please provide a CV and short cover letter. On your CV, include any relevant domain experience in game theory, and technical skills and experience in software engineering. We recommend to read through the Project Ideas below before submitting an application.

In your cover letter please include answers to the following questions:
1. What interests you most about the Gambit project?
2. Which specific project idea(s) are you most interested in and why?
    Note: While we do not rule out contributors proposing their own ideas, projects need to align with Gambit’s overall goals and must be feasible given the time available and your skills. Please cover how these aspects are met if you propose your own idea.
3. Please provide us with details of the times of day and days of the week you intend to work on the project, to help us in scheduling regular catch ups.
4. Is there anything that you’ll be studying or working on whilst working alongside us?

## Project Ideas

Prospective contributors should read through the project ideas listed below before submitting an application, following the Contributor Guidance above.
Select a project based on your research interests and the technical experience you have, or would like to develop.

#### Updating the Gambit GUI

For example with the facility to load from the catalog.

#### A layout algorithm for game trees

Working on a `draw_tree` package layout algorithm that doesn't rely on Gambit.

#### Working on Gambit interoperability with SageMath

The first step of this could be to add a tutorial to the Gambit documentation demonstrating the current level of interoperability. See GitHub issue [#627](https://github.com/gambitproject/gambit/issues/627).

#### Updating how Gambit works with external solves

Exporting a mathematical program from Gambit to a standard format that can be used by external solvers, e.g. in a format that can be used by linear program solvers.

#### Development of Lemke package

Working on the lemke package & integrating it as an optional dependency into Gambit.
