# Google Summer of Code 2026

The Gambit project is sumbitting projects as an organization for [Google Summer of Code 2026](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/).
Prospective contributors interested in working with the Gambit team should read the "Contributor Guidance" and "Project Ideas" sections below.

> Google Summer of Code is a global, online program focused on bringing new contributors into open source software development. GSoC Contributors work with an open source organization on a 12+ week programming project under the guidance of mentors.

## Contributor Guidance

Please provide a CV and short cover letter. On your CV, include any relevant domain experience in game theory, and technical skills and experience in software engineering. We recommend to read through the Project Ideas below before submitting an application.

In your cover letter please include answers to the following questions:
1. What interests you most about the Gambit project?
2. Which specific project idea(s) are you most interested in and why?
    Note: While we do not rule out contributors proposing their own ideas, projects need to align with Gambit’s overall goals and must be feasible given the time available and your skills. Please cover how these aspects are met if you propose your own idea.
3. Please provide us with details of the times of day and days of the week you intend to work on the project, to help us in scheduling regular catch ups.
4. Is there anything that you’ll be studying or working on whilst working alongside us?

## Project Ideas

Prospective contributors should read through the project ideas listed below before submitting an application, following the Contributor Guidance above.
Select a project based on your research interests and the technical experience you have, or would like to develop.

#### Updating the Gambit GUI

For example with the facility to load from the catalog.

#### A layout algorithm for visualising game trees

Extensive form game trees differ from other kinds of decision trees (in graph theory) due to the presence of information sets, which make drawing such trees a unique challenge not addressed by other software packages.
In Game Theory, information sets group decision nodes based on the information available to players, which is of particular importantance in games involving imperfect information.

The Gambit project team have developed `draw_tree`, a Python package which works in tandem with `pygambit` (Gambit's Python implementation) to draw extensive form game trees. The package is already used in in Gambit's Python tutorial documentation, but is also intended to be used for other purposes, in particular generating publication-ready images of game trees for research papers.

The best current layout algorithm used in `draw_tree` is based on code originally developed for Gambit's GUI software, which doesn't nicely render all the examples in Gambit's catalog of games, especially large ones with many information sets. The aim of the GSoC project would be to develop a new layout algorithm that can sensibly draw games of various sizes and complexity, including many information sets.

This project would suit someone who has a particular interest in visualisation challenges. For reference, check out the ["Stripped-down poker"](https://gambitproject.readthedocs.io/en/stable/tutorials/03_stripped_down_poker.html) tutorial from the `pygambit` documentation, which demonstrates how `pygambit` is used to construct, and `draw_tree` is used to visualise, a small extensive form game, including an explanation of the information sets present in the game.

#### Working on Gambit interoperability with SageMath

The first step of this could be to add a tutorial to the Gambit documentation demonstrating the current level of interoperability. See GitHub issue [#627](https://github.com/gambitproject/gambit/issues/627).

#### Updating how Gambit works with external solves

Exporting a mathematical program from Gambit to a standard format that can be used by external solvers, e.g. in a format that can be used by linear program solvers.

#### Development of Lemke package

Working on the lemke package & integrating it as an optional dependency into Gambit.
