**Gambit** is an open-source collection of tools for doing
computation in game theory. With Gambit, you can build, analyze,
and explore strategic interactions using noncooperative game theory.

Use Gambit's graphical interface to get
intuition about simple games, or the command-line tools and
Python extension to support
your world-class research and practical applications.

To learn more, you can
[browse the documentation](https://gambitproject.readthedocs.io/en/stable),
[install Gambit](install), or

Gambit development is supported in part by
[The Alan Turing Institute](https://www.turing.ac.uk)
as part of its project,
[Automated analysis of strategic interactions](https://www.turing.ac.uk/research/research-projects/automated-analysis-strategic-interactions).
