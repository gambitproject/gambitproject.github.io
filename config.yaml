      - "Gambit is a set of software tools for doing computation on finite, noncooperative games in extensive or strategy form and a set of file formats for storing and communicating games to external tools."
      - "The Gambit Project was founded in the mid-1980s at the California Institute of Technology and to this day is actively developed by a community of contributors, with core development led by [The Alan Turing Institute](https://www.turing.ac.uk) as part of its project: [Automated analysis of strategic interactions](https://www.turing.ac.uk/research/research-projects/automated-analysis-strategic-interactions)."
